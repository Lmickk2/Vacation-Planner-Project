# Vactaion Planner: Explore Miami

## Description
We created a dashboard for potential visitors to the city of Miami. The dashboard includes a display of Miamiâ€™s current weather (accompanied by a 5-day forecast), a list of local attractions and events, as well as other details a tourist would want/need to know about the Magic city. The user can search for an event and generate suggestions to local events via a drop-down menu. This application runs in the browser and features dynamic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, third-party APIs, JQuery,  Bootstrap, Moment.js, and localStorage
